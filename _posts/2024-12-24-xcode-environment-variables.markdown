Environment variables are powerful, often overlooked tools that can shape the way your iOS app behaves at runtime. With proper usage, you can control logging, test modes, and even the dynamic linking process—all without having to rebuild your application each time. This post compiles **all** the important Xcode environment variables you should know about, including both system-level and **DYLD** (Dynamic Linker) variables.

## What Are Environment Variables?

In simple terms, **environment variables** are key-value pairs that influence the runtime behavior of your application. They come in handy for:

- **Debugging**: Toggling verbose logs or specialized checks.  
- **Testing**: Simulating different configurations (e.g., test endpoints or feature flags).  
- **Performance Analysis**: Monitoring how your app starts up and loads frameworks.  

Because these variables don’t require code changes, they’re incredibly convenient for iterative development and QA testing.

## Configuring Environment Variables in Xcode

1. **Open Your Scheme**  
   - Select your project in the Navigator, then choose **Edit Scheme…**.

2. **Select the Run Section**  
   - In the left sidebar, choose the **Run** option under your scheme.

3. **Go to Arguments**  
   - Switch to the **Arguments** tab. You’ll see two areas:
     - **Arguments Passed On Launch**: Flags appended to the launch command.  
     - **Environment Variables**: Key-value pairs available to your app at runtime.

4. **Add a New Environment Variable**  
   - Click the **+** button under Environment Variables.
   - Enter the name of your variable (e.g., `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE`) and its value (e.g., `disable`).
   - Ensure the checkbox is **checked** so it’s active during launch.

## Common System Environment Variables

Below are some frequently used environment variables in iOS projects.

### OS_ACTIVITY_MODE
- **Purpose:** Controls how much log output is shown from Apple’s unified logging system (`os_log`).  
- **Values:**  
  - `default` – Normal logging.  
  - `disable` – Turns off all logging output.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Helps declutter your Xcode console by eliminating system logs you don’t need during debugging.

### CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS
- **Purpose:** Enables detailed logging of network activities at a low level.  
- **Value:** Set to `1` to activate.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Troubleshoot complex networking issues, especially if you suspect certain requests are failing silently.

### NSDebugEnabled
- **Purpose:** Activates additional internal debug checks within Foundation.  
- **Value:** `YES` to enable.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Helpful for deep debugging in complex Foundation-based logic or custom classes.

### UI_TEST_MODE (Custom)
- **Purpose:** A custom variable commonly used to distinguish between normal runs and UI test runs.  
- **Value:** `true` or `false`.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Allows you to bypass login flows, disable animations, or otherwise customize the UI for automated testing.  
  - Access it via `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["UI_TEST_MODE"]` in Swift.

## DYLD Environment Variables

**DYLD** environment variables instruct the dynamic linker on how to locate and load libraries or frameworks. While many are restricted on physical iOS devices for security reasons, they can still be powerful when debugging in the **iOS Simulator** or on macOS.

### DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
- **Purpose:** Tells the dynamic linker where to look for libraries **before** the default system library paths.  
- **Value:** A colon-separated list of directories.  
  - Example: `/Users/username/libs:/usr/local/lib`.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Load a custom or modified version of a library to test how it behaves in your app.

### DYLD_FRAMEWORK_PATH
- **Purpose:** Similar to `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH`, but specifically for frameworks (`.framework` bundles).  
- **Value:** A colon-separated list of directories.  
  - Example: `/Users/username/Frameworks`.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Override the path to frameworks, letting you experiment with different versions during development.

### DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES
- **Purpose:** Inject one or more dynamic libraries into your app’s process at launch.  
- **Value:** A colon-separated list of library paths.  
  - Example: `/path/to/customLibrary.dylib:/another/lib.dylib`.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Useful for advanced debugging or hooking in libraries.  
  - **Note:** Generally restricted on physical iOS devices, so it’s most effective on the simulator.

### DYLD_IMAGE_SUFFIX
- **Purpose:** Appends a suffix to library or framework names when they are loaded.  
- **Value:** A string suffix.  
  - Example: `_debug` so that `UIKit` becomes `UIKit_debug`.  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - If you maintain separate debug builds of frameworks, you can automatically pick the debug versions for testing.

### DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS
- **Purpose:** Prints detailed statistics about the app’s launch process, including load times and memory usage of linked libraries.  
- **Value:** `1` (or any non-empty string).  
- **Why Use It?**  
  - Gain insight into how fast your app is loading frameworks and identify possible bottlenecks.  
  - Example output might show total pre-main time, rebase/bind times, and the number of images loaded.

## Best Practices

1. **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**  
   - Don’t include API keys or tokens in environment variables within your Xcode scheme. Use a secure storage or dedicated configuration management solution.

2. **Use Descriptive Names**  
   - Variables like `DEBUG_VERBOSE_LOGGING` or `API_ENDPOINT_URL` make it clear what they control.

3. **Leverage `ProcessInfo`**  
   - Read environment variables from Swift via `ProcessInfo.processInfo.environment["VARIABLE_NAME"]`. This way, you can programmatically enable or disable features at runtime.

4. **Mind the Checkboxes**  
   - Always verify the environment variables are checked in the scheme; otherwise, they won’t take effect.

5. **Share Schemes Wisely**  
   - If your Xcode schemes are version-controlled, ensure you don’t accidentally commit sensitive or local paths.

6. **Remember iOS Device Restrictions**  
   - Most DYLD variables won’t work on a physical iPhone or iPad due to security constraints. Use them primarily on the simulator or macOS.

## Conclusion

Environment variables—both standard and DYLD—are integral to tailoring your app’s behavior for debugging, testing, and performance analysis. Whether you’re reducing console clutter with `OS_ACTIVITY_MODE`, diagnosing networking with `CFNETWORK_DIAGNOSTICS`, or investigating load times with `DYLD_PRINT_STATISTICS`, these tools can save you time and headaches in the long run.
